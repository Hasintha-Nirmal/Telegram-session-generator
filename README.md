# Telegram-session-generator
I'll help you create a Python script to generate a Telegram string session using Pyrogram and save it to your Telegram saved messages.

 
To use this script:

1. First install the required package:
```bash
pip install pyrogram
```

2. Run the script and it will:
   - Ask for your API ID and Hash (get these from https://my.telegram.org)
   - Connect to Telegram
   - Generate a string session
   - Automatically save it to your Telegram Saved Messages
   - Display success message

The script includes error handling and clear instructions. The session string will be saved securely in your Saved Messages, which you can access only from your account.

Would you like me to explain any part of the code or add additional features?
